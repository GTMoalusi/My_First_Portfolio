        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Thabang Moalusi, a passionate and driven aspiring Software
          Engineer with a strong foundation in both Information Technology and
          Chemical Engineering. I'm transitioning into the tech industry to
          pursue my goal of building meaningful, impactful software solutions
          that solve real-world problems. <br />
          <br />
          I'm currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” powerful
          tools that are helping me bring my ideas to life through websites and
          applications. I enjoy exploring how code works behind the scenes and
          am especially motivated by problem-solving, continuous learning, and
          the opportunity to grow within collaborative and innovative
          development teams. <br />
          <br />With my background in technical and process-driven environments,
          I bring a unique perspective to software development. I'm actively
          building projects to sharpen my skills and look forward to
          contributing to open-source communities and tech companies that value
          growth, inclusion, and real impact.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have a unique background that combines technical expertise and
          hands-on industry experience. I hold a National Diploma in Chemical
          Engineering and a BSc in Information Technology, where I graduated
          with cum laude, majoring in network engineering. My professional
          journey began in the manufacturing, I have held several positions such
          as Brewing Technical Operator, Packaging Quality and Compliance
          Analyst, and Packaging Team Leader. I developed strong leadership, and
          problem-solving skills. As I transition into the tech field, I'm
          focused on mastering web development tools such as Python, HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript. Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new technologies,
          exploring data-driven solutions, and applying logic to creative
          problem-solving. In my free time, I'm also passionate about
          self-improvement, reading books, and building systems that improve
          efficiency. I am also a great chess player.
